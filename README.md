# BlackCatMuzzle-rEFInd

## [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a simplistic boot manager for UEFI-based systems. This is a clean, dark and cute theme for it.

### Usage
1. Locate your refind EFI directory. This is commonly `/boot/EFI/refind` though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is installed.

2. Create a folder called `themes` inside it, if it doesn't already exist.

3. Clone this repository, [customize](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/configfile.html) `BlackCatMuzzle/theme.conf` if needed. E.g. you can change the default banner with cat to the fully black one by changing the appropriate line in `theme.conf` like this:
   ```
   banner themes/BlackCatMuzzle/bg/background_empty.png
   ```

4. Copy the `BlackCatMuzzle` folder into `themes` directory.

5. Add the following line at the end of `refind.conf`:
   ```
   include themes/BlackCatMuzzle/theme.conf
   ```
